## Submitting a Contract or DApp Template

Want to add a new template to create-mn-app? Follow these steps:

### Template Requirements

- **Public GitHub repo** under `midnightntwrk` org (or your own org with permission)
- **Working build** — the project must compile and run on Preprod
- **README.md** — clear setup and usage instructions
- **Node.js 22+** compatible
- **Compact compiler** version 0.28.0+ (for contract/dapp templates)

### Template Categories

| Category | Use case | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `contract` | Deploy and test a contract (no UI) | `hello-world` |
| `dapp` | Full app with UI and/or CLI | `counter`, `bboard` |
| `connector` | Integration patterns and examples | *(coming soon)* |

### How to Submit

1. **Prepare your repo** — ensure it builds cleanly with `npm install && npm run build`

2. **Register the template** in `src/utils/templates.ts`:

   ```typescript
   {
     name: "your-template",
     display: "Your Template",
     description: "One-line description of what it does",
     available: true,
     type: "remote",
     category: "dapp",          // or "contract" / "connector"
     repo: "midnightntwrk/example-your-template",
     nodeVersion: 22,
     requiresCompactCompiler: true,
     compactVersion: "0.28.0",
     projectStructure: [
       "contract/     smart contract (compact)",
       "your-cli/     cli interface",
     ],
     setupSteps: [
       {
         title: "Build",
         commands: [
           "cd {{projectName}}",
           "{{installCmd}}",
           "cd contract && {{runCmd}} build",
         ],
       },
       {
         title: "Proof Server",
         commands: [
           "docker run -d -p 6300:6300 -e PORT=6300 midnightntwrk/proof-server:7.0.0",
         ],
       },
       {
         title: "Run",
         commands: ["{{runCmd}} start"],
       },
     ],
   }
   ```

   Use `{{projectName}}`, `{{installCmd}}`, and `{{runCmd}}` placeholders — they resolve to the user's chosen package manager automatically.

3. **Update docs** — add your template to the README table under the appropriate category

4. **Submit a PR** with:
   - The template registration in `templates.ts`
   - README update
   - A brief description of the template and a link to the source repo

### Testing Your Template

```bash
npm run build
node dist/cli.js my-app -t your-template    # test the clone + setup flow
node dist/cli.js my-app -t your-template --dry-run  # verify dry-run output
```
